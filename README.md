# Team Project - *Eventify*

**Eventify** is an app that uses OCR to recognize dates and reminds the user using the inputted data.

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## Description
When you're a busy person, you tend to forget all of the dates and times that you see all around you. It's crucial to keep track of each of the events that you're associated with. That's what Eventify is for.
Eventify is an app that shows all of the events that you have currently saved and allows you to take pictures of flyers, posters, assignments, prescription bottles, etc. to save more events. It can also work with Facebook Events, so you can have all of your reminders in one place.
The challenge that we will face when developing this app is using OCR to successfully detect dates.

## API
For this app, we will be using clarifai's API (specifically its OCR endpoint) and FireBase for storing our own data.
For our FireBase API, we will need tables for users and events associated to the users (columns including date, time, title, note/description, and links).
